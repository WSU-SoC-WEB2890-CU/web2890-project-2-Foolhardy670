        <p class="p-5 fs-5">"Coach Don is an absolute AMAZING Life Saver.
          I had never budgeted before, my financial situation had collapsed several times and I chose not to do anything
          about it.
          I just felt it would get better on its own and of course, it never did. I finally wanted to CHANGE my
          situation after my
          second divorce, Don took me through the systematic process. I was so thrilled with the excitement and passion
          he had in
          helping others achieve success and truly succeed."</p>
