                    marriage that left me terrified of budgeting and finances. Don became my financial coach helping me face my anxieties
                    and setting up a spending plan in the EveryDollar App. He has been my kind, financial Sherpa. From sinking funds to
                    mutual funds, he was there sharing knowledge and answering a lot of questions. It’s been three months and I’m no longer
                    afraid. Instead, budgeting and investing for my future is fast becoming like a fun game, one I am now winning. Thank
